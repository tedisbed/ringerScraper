The decision was once again driven by money: If these shows are impossible to watch, WBD doesn’t have to pay residuals to anyone responsible for making them. But the fact that this cloud of capitalism has descended on HBO proper is the true difference—\u003cem\u003eWestworld \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eThe Nevers \u003c/em\u003eweren’t massively successful, but they had the HBO name on them, which means a lot. Or at least it did. If HBO’s parent company sees no value in the most prestigious brand in the television landscape, should anyone else? And what does this mean for the impending merger of HBO Max and Discovery+? Will the latter truly subsume the former and turn HBO into mostly a memory? (WBD announced belatedly on December 14 that they will license “some” of their de-platformed to third party free ad-supported television (FAST) channels until it builds its own.) The only thing that’s certain is that this isn’t the end of the upheaval at WBD. —\u003cem\u003eAndrew Gruttadaro\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","production_status":true,"staging_status":true,"id":"LLHTQIKtArBfHL8pbrQo"},{"writeup":"\u003cp\u003eOn the one hand, Netflix seems to be churning out record-making hits on the reg right now (if you believe the metrics, which come directly from Netflix and are only ever reported when they’re good).

It’s a delicate flower, one that could easily be crushed by a frivolous lawsuit, or a profit-minded executive, or a user-unfriendly interface that drives its own employees to fraud.

She goes through a series of physical exercises to try to regain control of her body after suffering brain damage during an attack in Afghanistan, relearning basic coordination skills and the ability to walk unaided. She’s clearly resentful of the situation, having to rely on a nurse to go to the bathroom or drive. Yet there’s no self-pity in Lawrence’s performance. The hurt and the shame are tangible, but so is the tendency toward self-preservation and isolation. Throughout the movie, first-time feature director Lila Neugebauer avoids pathos and instead focuses on the brutal reality of rehabilitation, the hopes dashed by relapses, and the terror of being betrayed by one’s own body. —\u003ca href=\"https://www.theringer.com/movies/2022/11/4/23440345/jennifer-lawrence-causeway-oscars-performance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMani Lazic\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","deleted":0,"updated":1668526307.652,"id":"LVad4X8gePir0JVsFxxy"},{"writeup":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eLove Is Blind\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003elaunched\u003c/strong\u003e the day before Valentine’s Day 2020, it was easy to dismiss as a gimmick: an\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.theringer.com/tv/2020/2/12/21133812/netflix-reality-tv-streaming-shift-the-circle-love-is-blind\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eunofficial companion piece\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;to \u003cem\u003eThe Circle\u003c/em\u003e,\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003eand another attempt by Netflix to cement its foothold in the reality TV space.

Mr. Washington plays John Creasy, a depressed and down-on-his-heels former special forces operative who is reduced to bodyguarding for a wealthy, very possibly drug-connected family. Their precocious young daughter, Pita (Dakota Fanning), touches Creasy’s ruined heart, pulling him out of his shell. So, of course, because every middle-aged-man revenge tale needs a precipitating incident usually involving the death, violation, or abduction of a wife, daughter, or daughter figure, she’s eventually kidnapped. Creasy goes on a fire-and-brimstone mission of wanton but very focused destruction, tearing the kidnapping cartel down piece by piece, setting fire to a dance club, torturing informants, shooting rocket-propelled grenades in suburban neighborhoods, and putting an explosive pen in a dude’s butt. In the end, Pita is freed and Creasy dies, more rubble than man. Had the late Tony Scott realized what a cottage industry revenge pictures would soon be, Creasy would probably be with us now, applying his particular set of skills to untold sequels. —\u003ca href=\"https://www.theringer.com/movies/2017/11/21/16673986/best-denzel-washington-movies\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eJason Concepcion\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","deleted":0,"title":"Man on Fire","staging_status":true,"related_content":[{"related":"LF5fLQj529EaEbXV7NDd","featured":""},{"featured":"","related":"NLlPh4pA9Xhw80vmLJIi"}],"order":240,"category":"shows","id":"S0SJ66ld4AqWpKLVDPGI"},{"platforms.hulu":"https://www.hulu.com/series/ramy-4bcb6c3a-3d9a-4d49-b8e0-57fb7de9c8d6","staging_status":true,"production_status":true,"tags":"quick,hybrid,not tv nerd,spongebob squarepants","title":"Ramy","related_content":[{"related":"QhTSuOW87DGtoDZZjaMA","featured":""},{"featured":"","related":"vQ16OKBVIWo8CxEpVKlJ"}],"order":68,"type":"ringerstreaming","writeup":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan class=\"ql-cursor\"\u003e﻿\u003c/span\u003eDespite the genuine novelty\u003c/strong\u003e of its representation in the context of American television, \u003cem\u003eRamy\u003c/em\u003e fits into a recognizable template.

It’s magical, mentioning brigades of owls and adults in strange cloaks, then showing a professorial Animagus, a flying motorcycle, and a wizard named Albus with a twinkle in his eye. \"The Boy Who Lived\" starts a lengthy build toward a climax, yielding, eventually, a battle between that boy and the Dark Lord whose soul suffered eight distinct deaths.

After crashing a hypersonic jet in the opening scenes, Maverick gets grounded and reassigned to the flight academy. It’s not just a new assignment; for Maverick, it’s akin to death. “The future is coming,” his gruff superior tells him. “And you’re not in it.” Technically, he’s talking about how drones are making human pilots like Maverick unnecessary, but he might as well be telling Cruise that movie stars aren’t important in the age of uncanny CGI and franchise hegemony. Not to worry: Over the course of the film, Maverick finds renewed purpose as a mentor to the young pilots, and Cruise wears it well. The character makes amends with Rooster (Miles Teller), Goose’s son, who blames Maverick for holding him back in his Navy career. He properly guides the cocky, young Hangman (Glen Powell), who surely reminds Maverick of himself, by keeping him grounded during the final assignment, which puts him in just the right spot to save the day when Maverick and Goose are in danger. The transition from hotshot to aging mentor seems so natural that it actually comes as a surprise when Maverick—and Cruise—wrestles back the controls at the last minute and spends the last 30 minutes performing the most death-defying stunts of his career. —\u003ca href=\"https://www.theringer.com/movies/2022/5/31/23143642/tom-cruise-top-gun-maverick-career-arc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eNoah Gittell\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","platforms":{"paramount":"https://www.paramountplus.com/movies/video/Alcn0hcGx0HosdhcawKteH8DXh3RiOF7/"},"production_status":true,"category":"shows","order":265,"title":"Top Gun: Maverick","image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/streamingguide-theringer-com-cms/public/media/ringerstreaming/shows/maverick (1).jpg","related_content":[{"related":"2wWclNq3Gji7PFRz2kq8","featured":""},{"featured":"","related":"7hTjgD9gwH4J9qztlvHv"}],"tags":"movie,action,army","deleted":0,"updated":1671813711.31,"type":"ringerstreaming","id":"c1th8u1lF9aErY7MDvk8"},{"type":"ringerstreaming","staging_status":true,"tags":"Movie,Drama,Romance,Sports","related_content":[{"related":"9sRG9Qmb4nrD3M1NDZ2Y","featured":""},{"related":"JyKfqWCE3Sd1r4ReP8F9","featured":""}],"writeup":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGina Prince-Bythewood’s semi-autobiographical film\u003c/strong\u003e follows Monica Wright (Sanaa Lathan) and Quincy McCall (Omar Epps) as they discover their talents and decipher their complex relationships—with basketball, with their families, with each other.

Every member of the cast, whether it’s with the simmering misery of Jeremy Allen White’s Carmy or the abrasive charisma of Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s Richie, does just enough to shine without distracting from the ensemble. … Any time \u003cem\u003eThe Bear\u003c/em\u003e is on the edge of making the easier, more expected decision, it veers into something more interesting—even if it’s imperfect. —\u003ca href=\"https://www.theringer.com/tv/2022/7/1/23190450/whats-streaming-on-netflix-in-july-2022-hulu-amazon-prime-apple-disney-hbo-max\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCharles Holmes\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","order":9,"deleted":0,"staging_status":true,"related_content":[{"related":"RsuOqJgcQ0LEPRgF7nCd"},{"related":"6lCu8z1NpQcYfCCoAYw3"}],"tags":"quick,drama,tv nerd,emmanuel the emu,food,family","platforms.hulu":"https://www.hulu.com/series/the-bear-05eb6a8e-90ed-4947-8c0b-e6536cbddd5f","type":"ringerstreaming","image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/streamingguide-theringer-com-cms/public/media/ringerstreaming/shows/The_Bear_101_20210707_0043 (1).jpg","id":"lw4o5xtu0cNKXslMD4gt"},{"category":"shows","order":280,"staging_status":true,"tags":"movie,international","image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/streamingguide-theringer-com-cms/public/media/ringerstreaming/shows/bardo.jpg","type":"ringerstreaming","writeup":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“Bardo” is the Buddhist term\u003c/strong\u003e for the liminal state between death and rebirth—just in case you were wondering, or wanted to know what to expect before heading into the latest, semi-autobiographical film from legendary Mexican director Alejandro G.

Artists best-equipped to market their sound with compelling visuals reached newfound levels of fame: the maximalist boy bands ’NSync and the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, TLC, and rappers with enticing narratives and crossover potential like Jay-Z. And also some weirder phenomena: Lou Bega’s mambo revival, Eiffel 65’s all-blue-everything. \u003ci\u003eTRL\u003c/i\u003e, and pop music in general, was a marketing machine\u0026mdash;and the artists who were most marketable thrived.\u0026nbsp;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, albums were still important\u0026mdash;Napster had not yet delivered the death blow\u0026mdash;and for more invested listeners, an important explosion and collision of genres was underway. Hip-hop was further and further expanding its market share in the mainstream; the grunge of the early ’90s had given way to a more accessible version dubbed pop-punk; emo was on the rise; indie music was having a renaissance; and bands like Rage Against the Machine, the Roots, and Nine Inch Nails were blurring the lines between genres.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is why, for \u003ci\u003eThe Ringer\u003c/i\u003e’s retrospective ranking of music in 1999, we decided to separate the singles from the albums\u0026mdash;to fully encapsulate the depth, range, and utter weirdness of music 20 years ago.

But when the calendar changed from October to November in 2019, so too did the entire streaming industry. Apple TV+ launched on the first of the month, flanked by stars like Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carell, and Jason Momoa; 11 days later, Disney+ put its stake in the ground with an instant phenomenon. (Two words: Baby Yoda.) Others would join over the following months: HBO Max in May 2020, NBCUniversal’s Peacock in July, and later Paramount+, a rebrand of CBS All Access. (And also Quibi; let us not forget the quick bites.) What was already a hard-to-navigate landscape—2019 offered 532 original scripted series—had become impossibly flooded, as the biggest corporations in the entertainment (and tech!) businesses clamored for a piece of the streaming pie.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlmost two years later, things have calmed down. Just kidding—the Streaming Wars are more chaotic than they’ve ever been. Netflix is finally starting to show some cracks, HBO Max won’t even be called HBO Max 12 months from now, and Prime Video is on the verge of dropping the most expensive show in television history. As the competitive pool gets crowded and Netflix’s massive head start gets erased, the fight for streaming preeminence grows more and more heated.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat makes for pretty fun scoreboard-watching—and pretty complicated TV watching. Which is why we’re introducing this section to not only keep tabs on the ever-changing Streaming Wars, but also to explain how those developments translate to you, the person who’s doing the streaming. Every week, we’ll use a proprietary formula to determine how the biggest players in the Streaming Wars stack up against each other—and more importantly, which ones are worth your hard-earned cash. When Netflix has a record-breaking hit on its hands, we’ll explain how that helps its standing in the larger race; when HBO Max has an earnings call that makes the internet ask existential questions about the future of all media, that’ll be reflected here, as well. \u003cem\u003eThe Ringer\u003c/em\u003e’s Streaming Wars formula takes five different factors into account:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA streaming service’s quality of TV content (and not just original content)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA service’s buzz or hype (\u003cem\u003eDid it have a good week?\u003c/em\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA service’s level of prestige (\u003cem\u003eDoes it win awards?\u003c/em\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA service’s utility as an app (\u003cem\u003eDoes it make TV watching better?\u003c/em\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe average cost of a service\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlugging these metrics into our formula—while giving particular weight to quality of content and buzz—produces a Streaming Wars score. The services with higher Streaming Wars scores are not only prevailing at the moment, but are also the ones most worth paying for. Knowing which streaming services are on top can feel downright impossible. And things are only going to get messier. Hopefully this guide can make it a little easier, and bring you back to the days when watching TV was so much simpler.\u003c/p\u003e","updated":"Updated 1/11","sidebar_promo":"6y3FEnMjYzPuaE8HX1Vq","headline":"Who's winning the Streaming Wars?"},"type":"99music","title":"Streaming Guide"},"settings":{"twitter_content_share":"It's hard to know what to watch.
